Preconditioned inexact Hermitian and skew-Hermitian splitting iteration approaches (PIHSS) and IHSS approaches
are proposed for modelling underground water flow. 
Our results revealed that the computational accuracy of the proposed schemes is high,
while the computational costs are lower compared with IHSS. Additionally,
the results revealed that the proposed PIHSS has excellent acceleration, 
that is, at least 60% acceleration compared with the IHSS.
